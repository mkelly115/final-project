## Description

This is an application created to be tailored for businesses with the purpose of providing a system and platform for managing and tracking projects. As students who work in cooperative groups, we noticed a need to have a simple and straightforward method of tracking projects and tasks. Therefore, we created a system for collaborative teams to manage their group projects with the intention of it being scaled up to serve larger businesses.

This project management tool web application allows authenticated users to sign up, log in, create projects, add team members, assign tasks, set deadlines, and track progress. 

This application uses several technologies including but not limited to: Node.js, Apollo Server, GraphQL, Material UI, JWT, bcrypt, React, Express.js, and MongoDB.
